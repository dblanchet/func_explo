When I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C6sv7-eTKg, I thought
it was a good time for me to return to functional programming "assembly"
fundamentals. I am very grateful to [David Beazley](https://www.dabeaz.com/)
for making such educational videos (and blog posts, etc.)

I first took [notes](func.py), then produced a [Jupyter
notebook](CalculusFundamentals.ipynb), and finally an article serie on my
internal (i.e. private) current employer publication platform. The article
serie is basically the notebook split in 3 parts.
