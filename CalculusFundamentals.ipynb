    "## A Bit of Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### High School\n",
    "\n",
    "Back when I was young, I discovered computers and programming with some high school friends that were making wonders with the help of a french copy of the [PC Bible](https://www.amazon.fr/Pc-Bible-Knorr/dp/0201883546) book.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, part of their coding was done with an obscure language they called assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was still fresh from BASIC and learning Pascal (with Turbo Pascal 6 then 7, anyone? ;-) ). Including x86 assembly in such development environments was easy, so I rapidly learned some of it, and discovered its counterparts: registers, bus, ports, cache, RAM, microcode, cycles, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not code in assembly anymore. But what I learned at that time still serves me today. In my opinion, having a reasonable model of how computers work when programming is underrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Shool\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years later, when I was studying Computer Science, some serious theoritical background came along, with terms like [Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) or [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "In those years, I was also supposed to learn about Lambda Calculus, Church et al. theoritical work on calculability. I think I completely missed the point at that time. I was rapidly lost when trying to \"relate\" this knowledge with anything I knew about computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a reason: I had never been exposed to any functional programming/reasonning before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to Present\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast-forward... I've now coded in a functional fashion with Swift, Kotlin, or Rust, had several looks into Haskell and Elm, and I'm leaning towards functional style or patterns in any language that does not prevent me from doing so, such as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C6sv7-eTKg, I thought it was a good time to return to functional programming \"assembly\" fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I found interesting in this video:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The speaker, [David Beazley](https://dabeaz.com/), does not take all those results for granted, and takes a questioning and exploratoring tone that I find pleasing.\n",
    "\n",
    " * He uses Python, a \"usual\" (non-primarily functional) and \"easy\" language to illustrate the various steps.\n",
    "\n",
    " * He spares me from decrypting the oh-so-obscure-to-me mathematical notations ( $(\\lambda x.x)y$... ) that pop up in a vast majority of the papers supposed to explain those concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "All those make less barriers and less cognitive load than the material I used for my previous attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing: David Beazley is bright, clever and very educational. Most of all, he regularly acknowledges that this topic is mind-bending, and I think I needed to hear that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what follows is my latest attempt at understanding parts of lambda-calculus and Y-combinator. Go exorcise a serie of personal failures!\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you will find this interesting. Or at least entertaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we go."

    "The idea is to build a computing model based exclusively on functions. In a way, it is a kind of game where you have to find out how to create and use the computing concepts that you use everyday without thinking too much about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can make this hard are the rules that we choose to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Beazley starts by setting a few simple rules, stating what is allowed and what is not, while trying to build the various concepts we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those rules are quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything is a function, nothing else.\n",

    "2. Each function has a single argument (that is a function, per previous rule).\n",
